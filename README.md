# CPSC 210 Personal Project

## Phase 0:

**Task 1**:
- _What will the application do?_
  - My application is a Java based blackjack game that can be played from the terminal or from a GUI. The game will keep track of the player's virtual money, as well as useful statistics such as win rate and play accuracy (according to the strategy chart).
- _Who will use it?_
  - Anyone from a student to a professional casino company. Anyone interested in playing or learning blackjack in their free time! 
- _Why is this project of interest to you?_
  - I'm an avid black jack player and I loved watching the movie 21 (even though I can't card count).
