# CPSC 210 Personal Project

## Phase 0:

**About The Project**:
- _What will the application do?_
  - My application is a Java based blackjack game that can be played from the terminal or from a GUI. The game will keep track of the player's virtual money, as well as useful statistics such as win rate and play accuracy (according to the strategy chart).
- _Who will use it?_
  - Anyone from a student to a professional casino company. Anyone interested in playing or learning blackjack in their free time! 
- _Why is this project of interest to you?_
  - I'm an avid black jack player and I loved watching the movie 21 (even though I can't card count). 

**User Stories**
- As a user, I want to be able to select a game difficulty that adds up to six decks to the game (each added deck increases the difficulty).
- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of past games and their outcomes, showing cash gained/lost.
- As a user, I want to be able to see overall player statistics such as tracking virtual money, win rate, play accuracy.
- As a user, I want to be able to have the option of resetting their progress (cash, statistics), or automatically doing so when they run out of money.
- As a user, I want to be able to save the state of the game that they are currently playing (score and stats) or have the option to not save.
- As a user, I want to be able to have the option to retrieve the last saved game stats and scores from file. 
- As a user, I want to be able to view the game stats in a clear game UI
